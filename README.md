# TesterLib

This API SDK was automatically generated by APIMATIC v2.0 ([https://apimatic.io](https://apimatic.io)).

## Configuration

The generated client class accepts the configuration parameters in its constructors.

## Build

The generated code uses a java library namely UniRest. The reference to this
library is already added as a maven dependency in the generated gradle build
file. Therefore, you will need internet access to resolve this dependency.

For build process do the following:

1. Open Android Studio and use "Import Project" option. 
2. Browse to the generated SDK, select the unarchived folder "TesterLib" and click "Ok".
3. Press Ctrl+F9 or use "Make Project" menu command to build and resolve all dependencies.

## Test

The generated code and the server can be tested using autoamtically generated test cases. 

For test process do the following:

1. Navigate to "TesterLib -> java -> org.hopto.apimatic (androidTest)".
2. Right click and click on "Run tests in org.hopto.apimatic (androidTest)".
3. Select your emulator an click "Ok".

## Usage

The build process generates android library, which can be used just like an
ordinary AAR library. See the following link for more information on this
